# GenAI Launchpad

With AI innovation moving beyond the speed of light, your time to develop is now more precious than ever. That’s why we’ve built the GenAI Launchpad – your secret weapon to shipping production-ready AI apps, faster.

## Introduction

Welcome to the GenAI Launchpad – your all-in-one repository for building powerful, scalable Generative AI applications. Whether you’re prototyping or deploying at scale, this Docker-based setup has you covered with everything from event-driven architecture to seamless AI pipeline integration.

No need to start from scratch or waste time on repetitive configurations. The GenAI Launchpad is engineered to get you up and running fast, with a flexible design that fits your workflow – all while keeping things production-ready from day one.

> **Note**: This repository has two main branches:
> - [`main`](https://github.com/datalumina/genai-launchpad/tree/main): Contains a complete example implementation to demonstrate the Launchpad's capabilities
> - [`boilerplate`](https://github.com/datalumina/genai-launchpad/tree/boilerplate): A stripped-down version with just the core components, perfect for starting new projects.
>
> We recommend following the Accelerator Course first to understand the example implementation in the `main` branch before exploring the boilerplate branch for your own projects.

## Overview

The GenAI Launchpad isn’t just another framework – it’s your shortcut to a production-ready AI infrastructure. Built for speed and control, its modular architecture brings together the best tools and design patterns to help you deploy faster without compromising flexibility.

Here’s what you’re working with:

- FastAPI for lightning-fast API development
- Celery for background task processing
- PostgreSQL to handle all your data, includding embeddings
- Redis for fast task queue management
- Caddy for reverse proxy and automatic HTTPS

All services are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across development and deployment environments.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built-in support for designing and implementing event-driven systems.
- **AI Pipeline Support**: Pre-configured setup for integrating AI models and pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy expansion as your application grows.
- **Flexibility**: Modular architecture that allows for easy customization and extension.
- **Production-Ready**: Includes essential components for a production environment, including logging, monitoring, and security features.
- **Rapid Development**: Boilerplate code and project structure to accelerate development.
- **Docker-Based Deployment**: Complete Docker-based strategy for straightforward deployment.

## Documentation

While the code is already properly documented, we also included a dedicated `docs` folder in the repository. The documentation covers everything from initial setup through advanced topics like vector storage, LLM integration, and deployment strategies, organized into five main sections (Getting Started, Architecture, Core Components, Guides, and Concepts). For a complete overview and navigation through all topics, see the [documentation index](docs/README.md).

## Project Structure

The Launchpad follows a logical, scalable, and reasonably standardized project structure for building event-driven GenAI apps.
