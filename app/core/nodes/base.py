Base Node Module

This module defines the foundational Node class that all workflow nodes inherit from.
It implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, allowing nodes to process tasks

class Node(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all workflow processing nodes.

    Node implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, serving as the base
    handler for all workflow processing steps. Each concrete node implementation
    represents a specific processing step in the workflow chain.

    The Chain of Responsibility pattern is implemented through the process()
    method, which each node uses to:
    1. Receive the task context from the previous node
    2. Perform its specific processing
    3. Pass the updated context to the next node
