    TaskContext maintains the state and results of a workflow's execution,

    metadata throughout the processing flow.

        event: The original event that triggered the workflow
        nodes: Dictionary storing results and state from each node's execution
        metadata: Dictionary storing workflow-level metadata and configuration

    Example:
        context = TaskContext(
            event=incoming_event,
            nodes={"AnalyzeNode": {"score": 0.95}},
            metadata={"priority": "high"}
