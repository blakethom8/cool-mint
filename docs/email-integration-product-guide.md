# Email Integration Product Description Guide

## Overview
The email integration system allows physician liaisons and sales reps to interact with the CRM through their existing email workflow. By forwarding emails to a dedicated inbox, users can trigger AI-powered actions that streamline data entry, information retrieval, and relationship management.
