## Feature Backlog

### FEAT-001: Google Maps Street View Integration
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Moderate
**Category:** Integration, Verification

#### Description
Add a "Street View" button to site of service popups that opens Google Maps Street View for the selected location. This enables quick visual verification of whether a location is actually a medical facility.

#### User Story
As a physician liaison, I want to quickly view the Street View of a site of service so that I can visually verify if it's actually a medical practice before investing time in outreach.

#### Technical Considerations
- Google Maps Street View API integration
- URL construction with latitude/longitude coordinates
- Button placement in existing popup UI
- Handling locations where Street View may not be available
- Consider opening in new tab vs embedded view

#### Future Enhancements
- **Image Recognition Integration**: Use LLM/AI to automatically analyze Street View images and classify locations as medical vs non-medical facilities
- **Automated Verification**: Batch process all sites to pre-classify medical facilities
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide AI confidence scores for medical facility classification
- **Visual Indicators**: Show verification status directly on map markers

#### Implementation Notes
- Add button alongside existing "Get Directions" and "View Details" buttons
- Use Google Maps Street View URL format: `https://www.google.com/maps/@{lat},{lng},3a,75y,90t/data=!3m6!1e1`
- Consider fallback to regular Google Maps if Street View unavailable

### FEAT-002: Integrated Web Research & Doctor Information
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Idea
**Complexity:** Epic
**Category:** Research, Data Enhancement, User Experience

#### Description
Create an integrated web research system that allows users to explore doctor and provider information from the web without leaving the Market Explorer interface. This would eliminate the need for separate browser windows for research.

#### User Story
As a physician liaison, I want to research doctors' websites, services, and public information directly within Market Explorer so that I can efficiently gather intelligence without managing multiple browser windows.

#### Technical Considerations
- Web scraping vs API integrations
- Iframe embedding vs popup windows
- Data caching and storage
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling
- Legal considerations for web content access
- Performance impact on main application

#### Core Components
1. **Doctor Website Discovery**
   - Automatic website detection based on provider name and location
   - Integration with search engines (Google, Bing)
   - Medical directory integration (Healthgrades, WebMD, etc.)

2. **Embedded Web Browser**
   - In-app web browsing capability
   - Bookmarking and note-taking on web content
   - Screenshot capture for documentation

3. **Information Extraction**
   - Automatic extraction of key information (services, specialties, hours)
   - Contact information parsing
   - Patient review summaries

4. **Research History**
   - Track researched providers
   - Save important findings
   - Share research with team members

#### Future Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Use LLM to automatically summarize doctor websites and extract key insights
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare providers in the same area
- **Social Media Integration**: Include LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter profiles
- **Patient Review Analysis**: Aggregate and analyze patient reviews across platforms
- **News and Publications**: Find medical publications, news articles, research papers
- **Professional Network Mapping**: Identify professional connections and referral patterns

#### Implementation Approaches
1. **Phase 1**: Simple external links with organized bookmarking
2. **Phase 2**: Embedded iframe browser with basic navigation
3. **Phase 3**: Full web scraping and information extraction
4. **Phase 4**: AI-powered analysis and summarization
