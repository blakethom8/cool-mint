- [x] **Created LLMChat interface** - Full chat interface with message history, suggested prompts, and response management

#### LLM Integration with Anthropic Claude
- [x] **Migrated from OpenAI to Anthropic Claude API** - Successfully switched to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for advanced reasoning capabilities
- [x] **Fixed Anthropic API authentication** - Resolved Docker environment variable loading and API key configuration
- [x] **Implemented proper Anthropic message format** - Fixed system prompt handling (separate `system` parameter vs messages array)
- [x] **Built comprehensive conversation management** - Database storage of full conversation history with token tracking

#### Advanced Activity Context Processing  
- [x] **Rich structured data integration** - Leveraged existing `llm_context_json` field for detailed activity analysis
- [x] **Intelligent context inclusion** - Only includes full activity context on first message to optimize token usage
- [x] **Multi-layered activity data** - Basic info + structured context including contacts, specialties, geography, and relationships
- [x] **Smart conversation state management** - Proper frontend/backend state synchronization for message display

#### Database & API Architecture
